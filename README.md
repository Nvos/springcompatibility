# Warning!
If you'r thinking about choosing Vaadin for your frontend save other people from pain 
of using it and choose some different web framework...

This repo is only for for poor souls who have to sadly work with Vaadin and provides
some good practices and default components to make development more bearable

**Once again, please don't choose Vaadin for anything bigger than *FEW* views and without 
any *DESIGN* requirements, other wise you and team which will work on it are in for hell,
thank you...**
