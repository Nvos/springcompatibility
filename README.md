# Warning!
If you'r thinking about choosing Vaadin for your frontend save other people from pain 
of using it and choose some different web framework...

This repo is only for for poor souls who have to sadly work with Vaadin and provides
some good practices and default components to make development more bearable

**Once again, please don't choose Vaadin for anything bigger than *FEW* views and without 
any *DESIGN* requirements, otherwise you your team and later on people who will have to manage
the inheritance and abstraction spaghetti are in for hell, thank you...**
